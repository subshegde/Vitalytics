Act as a Senior Health Data Analyst responsible for generating a holistic patient summary and strategic health plan.

Your task is to analyze and synthesize the following six distinct data inputs regarding the patient:
1. Primary Diagnosis: **{DISEASE_TYPE}**
2. Conventional Treatment Plan: **{SUGGESTION_MEDICINE}**
3. Homeopathic Treatment Plan: **{SUGGESTION_HOMEOPATHY}**
4. Nutritional Supplementation Plan: **{SUGGESTION_NUTRITIONS}**
5. Patient Diet Summary (Logs): **{DIET_SUMMARY}**
6. Physical Progression Metrics: **{PROGRESSION_TRACKING}**

The final analysis must reconcile the suggested treatment paths (conventional vs. homeopathic) and integrate the nutritional adherence and progression data into a single, cohesive strategic conclusion.

Determine the overall_status (e.g., 'Stable', 'Needs Attention', 'Critical Review').

Calculate a composite diet_score (0-10) reflecting adherence and impact, and identify the progression_trend (e.g., 'Positive Gain', 'Stagnation', 'Regress').

Create a 'sections' array, with each entry containing a brief (1-2 sentence) summary of the findings for that topic, and the single most critical, consolidated, and actionable recommendation.

Your output MUST be a JSON object that strictly conforms to the ComprehensiveHealthSummary schema. The tone should be professional and focused on strategic, data-driven conclusions.
